- option for schedule to clear channel first (except pinned)
- host subcommand to view stats about users in the DB

- only register certain commands that i'm testing when running in debug mode 
- ping people selected for team
- add counter for number of people signed up

- add type reader support

- experiment with not needing the interaction service before going too far with it.
	- button builder idea
	- an action could only be used for a single command (would be fine for my use, but if we want to make a lib then maybe not.)

- add view all config settings subcommand

- update interaction service to save to file. auto delete messages older than n days.
- update action context to also store interactions when pming people.

- harden guild.GetUser against users no longer in the discord

- notifying people trying to sign up without having read rules
- regular sign ups for aod/raids/rago?
- combined raids signup

- winston picture command
- command to generate timestamps for events.

Done:
- role requirements for commands
- boss embed color
- ping blav every time he responds with the ping command
- command to lookup things on wiki
- split other config commands into subcommands
- signup subcommand to add/remove a user to/from the signup (use message id to target)
- implement actual aod team selection
- use dependency injection to inject services for commands
- improve logging
- test multiple people hitting buttons at once
