- add logging support to actions.

Multi-team;
- read dates when looking at history so we can support multiple teams
- store a guid for each history row (and store it in the message) so we can delete more accurately.
- each team should be a separate message so the pvm-signup commands still work.
- when removing a history row, pass in the team and validate. Or add an id column to the row and store that in the message.
- store signed up users in db so we don't have to worry about the bot restarting

- button to preview the selected team
- option for schedule to clear channel first (except pinned)
- host subcommand to view stats about users in the DB

- ping people selected for team
- add counter for number of people signed up

- add type reader support

- experiment with not needing the interaction service before going too far with it.
	- button builder idea
	- an action could only be used for a single command (would be fine for my use, but if we want to make a lib then maybe not.)

- add view all config settings subcommand

- update interaction service to save to file. auto delete messages older than n days.
- update action context to also store interactions when pming people.

- harden guild.GetUser against users no longer in the discord

- notifying people trying to sign up without having read rules
- regular sign ups for aod/raids/rago?
- combined raids signup

- winston picture command
- command to generate timestamps for events.

Done:
- role requirements for commands
- boss embed color
- ping blav every time he responds with the ping command
- command to lookup things on wiki
- split other config commands into subcommands
- signup subcommand to add/remove a user to/from the signup (use message id to target)
- implement actual aod team selection
- use dependency injection to inject services for commands
- improve logging
- test multiple people hitting buttons at once
- only register certain commands that i'm testing when running in debug mode 
- button to revert the completed team back to a signup so we can add/remove people and re-calculate
